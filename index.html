          <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as <q>Straw Hat Luffy</q> and commonly as <q>Straw Hat</q> , is the main
            protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous
            and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters. He desires to find the
            legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which would help
            facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to his brothers and crew. He believes that being
            the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>

              scars all over his body from his strenuous physical training and a large scar on his abdomen where one
