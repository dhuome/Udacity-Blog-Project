        <h2>Hi,I'm Abdulrahman</h2>
        <p>
          As an IT student, I consider myself a team player. I prefer learning and
          searching for information and learning on my own before relying on
          others because I believe that if a person tries and works hard to look
          for information, the information will become more solid than if he took
          it from others. I love to finish my work as quickly as possible. I am
          interested in designing and developing web interfaces, as well as
          developing mobile applications, and every day I see an opportunity to
          learn something new.
