        <p>Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into
          rubber. Thanks to his strong imagination, Luffy is able to wield the seemingly unthreatening abilities of
          his Devil Fruit to act as an incredibly competent fighter, often manipulating his own rubbery body into a
          variety of powerful forms. He is one of few individuals known to have awakened his Devil Fruit, which bestows
          him with mythical power. In addition to his Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy is one of few individuals capable
          of wielding all three forms of Haki and has mastered them to the point that he has developed advanced
          abilities..</p>
