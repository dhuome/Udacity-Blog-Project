        Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not
        require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other
        components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions
        that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for
        object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and
        several common framework related tools.

        Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn.
        Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.
        According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a
        serious application. The name is a play on the earlier Bottle framework.
