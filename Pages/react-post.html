        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building
        user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
        individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page,
        mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with
        state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
        additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
        React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta, who released an early prototype of React called
        "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on
        Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May
        2013.
