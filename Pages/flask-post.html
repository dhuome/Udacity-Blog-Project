        Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS
        frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or
        tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and
        matching.

        For example, in other traditional systems, there would be a class message-warning that would apply a yellow
        background color and bold text. To achieve this result in Tailwind, one would have to apply a set of classes
        created by the library: bg-yellow-200 and font-bold.

        As of January 2023, Tailwind CSS has over 63,000 stars on GitHub.

        The utility-first concept refers to the main differentiating feature of Tailwind.[6] Instead of creating classes
        around components (button, panel, menu, textbox ...), classes are built around a specific style element (yellow
        color, bold font, very large text, center element...). Each of these classes is called utility classes.

        There are many utility classes in TailwindCSS that enable to control a large number of CSS properties like
        colors, border, display type (display), font size and font, layout, shadow...
