        The AngularJS framework worked by first reading the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page, which had additional
        custom HTML attributes embedded into it. Angular interpreted those attributes as directives to bind input or
        output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those
        JavaScript variables could be manually set within the code or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.

        AngularJS was built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and
        connect software components, while imperative programming was better suited to defining an application's
        business logic. The framework adapted and extended traditional HTML to present dynamic content through
        two-way data-binding that allowed for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS
        de-emphasized explicit Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation with the goal of improving testability and
        performance.

        AngularJS's design goals included:

        to decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way
        the code is structured.
        to decouple the client side of an application from the server-side. This allows development work to progress in
        parallel and allows for reuse of both sides.
        to provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the
        business logic, to testing.
        AngularJS implemented the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components. Using dependency
        injection, Angular brought traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to
        client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server could be reduced.</p>
