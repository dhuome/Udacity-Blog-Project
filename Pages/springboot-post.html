        The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The
        framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web
        applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any
        specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise
        JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source. he first version was written by Rod Johnson, who
        released the framework with the publication of his book Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development in October
        2002. The framework was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. The first production release,
        1.0, was released in March 2004. The Spring 1.2.6 framework won a Jolt productivity award and a JAX
        Innovation Award in 2006. Spring 2.0 was released in October 2006, Spring 2.5 in November 2007, Spring 3.0
        in December 2009, Spring 3.1 in December 2011, and Spring 3.2.5 in November 2013. Spring Framework 4.0 was
        released in December 2013. Notable improvements in Spring 4.0 included support for Java SE (Standard Edition)
        8, Groovy 2, some aspects of Java EE 7, and WebSocket.
